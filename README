Howto build:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to sucessfully build the gr-specest modules you will need:
* cmake > 2.8
* swig
* libgnuradio-core
* libuhd
* gfortran (others might work as well, not tested)

After checking out the code from the repository, change to the gr-specest
directory. If you want to build with a different compiler such as clang
you might have to do something like:

export CXX=clang++
export CC=clang

before.

Create a new directory e.g. 'build' to do an out of source build:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
make install

For more information refer to the cmake documentation.

Howto add your own blocks to the GNU Radio Spectral Estimation Toolbox:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Your C++ or Fortran code goes into lib/
* Your Python code and your Python unittests go into python/
* Your swig stuff goes into swig/

Adding a new C++ file that does not depend on Armadillo:
--------------------------------------------------------
* As stated above, C++ code goes into lib/
* Your QA code goes into qa_specest_yourblockname.{h,cc}
  respectively qa_specesti_yourblockname.{h,cc} if it is an
  implementation block
* Your code for the actual block goes (usually) into
  specest_yourblock.{h,cc}
* To include your files in the buildsystem add them to the file
  lib/CMakeLists.txt by editing the following variables:
    * CXX_SRCS (Sourcecode)
    * CXX_QA_SRCS and CXX_QA (QA source and names of tests (i.e. your class name))

Adding a new C++ file that does depend on Armadillo:
-----------------------------------------------------
* For now, don't do it, as we're trying to get rid of the dependency sooner or later

Adding a new Fortran file:
--------------------------
* As stated above, Fortran code goes into lib/
* Up to now we're wrapping the fortran code into specesti_ implementation blocks
  so we don't have unittests to directly test the fortran code
* Your code goes into specesti_{c,z,f,d}yourblock.f90
* To include your files in the buildsystem add them to the file
  lib/CMakeLists.txt by editing the following variables:
    * F_SRCS (Sourcecode)

Adding a new Python file:
--------------------------
* As stated above, Python code goes into python/
* If it's a QA/test file, add it to python/CMakeLists.txt
  in the PYTHON_QA variable
* If it's a file that contains code that needs to be installed later, add it to python/CMakeLists.txt
  in the SPECEST_PY_SRCS variable

Swig integration:
-----------------
This works basically the same as with the autotools based build system
* Drop your *.i files into swig/ directory
* include them into the specest.i as it has been with the others
